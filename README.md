# RouterLogin

This repository is a proof of concept to discover the IP of a router in the local area and test the most common credentials to log in to its admin panel.
To work on a real router the POST request body would have to be edited to match the body sent by the client to the router.

## Usage

On Linux with cURL installed:

```bash
./main.sh
```

On Windows with Powershell:


```Powershell
.\main.ps1
```
